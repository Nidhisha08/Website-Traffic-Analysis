# Website-Traffic-Analysis

I recently worked on a project to analyze and optimize an e-commerce website. The main goal was to enhance user engagement and increase conversions through data-driven insights. I analyzed traffic sources, bounce rates, top-performing pages, and the conversion funnel to understand user behavior. I also performed A/B testing and bid optimization to measure the impact of different marketing strategies. The analysis provided valuable insights into user behavior and sales trends, helping identify areas for improvement. Overall, the project demonstrated how data-driven decisions can improve website performance and business growth.
